# Miami-Weekend-Google-Maps-API-

Hey everyone, I created this app using some of the API's provided by Google Maps. APIs used include Directions, Geocoding, Maps Javascript API, and the Places API. The purpose of this application is to display a set of markers for the user that mark hotspots in my hometown: Miami, Florida. These hotspots include nightclubs, bars, and resturants. Once a marker is clicked an infowindow appears with some general information and a section at the bottom half of the page appears displaying pictures, reviews, and more detailed information about the selected venue. The user can also input their address and a marker will be placed at the specified address. The user can then select a marker and by clicking "route" they can see the route from their location to their selected venue. 

Updates in the near future will include:
- Trip information like distance and time
- Responsive design and smaller viewport support
